public class Main {                           (Class called main that is public)
    public static void main(String[] args) {  (Public so anyone can see it, static means cannot create instance of main, void means it doesn't return a value, main is name)
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");  (system is pre-defined class, out is stdout, println is a method that can be used to print a line) 
    }
}

examples of classes

java.lang (system string object, thread, exception)
java.util (utility service calsses)
java.io (file input/output, includes keyboard input)
java.net
java.applet
java.awt (gui)
java.awt.event (gui)
java.sql (note learn sql)

type of variables
byte, short, int, long (float number)
float (float number)
char (character)
boolean (t or f)

int myNumber;
myNumber = 5;

int a = 4;

if (a == 4) {
    System.out.println("Ohhh! So a is 4!");
}

if (a == b) {
    // We already know this part
} else {
    // a and b are not equal... :/
}

int intArray[];    //declaring array
intArray = new int[20];  // allocating memory to array

int[] intArray = new int[20]; // combining both statements in one

boolean operators
int a = 4;
int b = 5;
boolean result;
result = a < b; // true
result = a > b; // false
result = a <= 4; // a smaller or equal to 4 - true
result = b >= 6; // b bigger or equal to 6 - false
result = a == b; // a equal to b - false
result = a != b; // a is not equal to b - true
result = a > b || a < b; // Logical or - true
result = 3 < a && a < 6; // Logical and - true
result = !result; // Logical not - false

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {}

while (condition) {}



public void bar(int num1, int num2) {
    ...
}

int a = 3;
int b = 5;
bar(a, b);

int num1 = a;
int num2 = b;



public class Student {
    private String name;
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}





Everything in Java is within classes and objects.



Core java is the basic foundation for Java. You can find the below topics covered as part of core Java.
 Although all topics are essentials to have complete grip on Java but in real time you may not need all of them.
The major topics are listed below:

1. Java Basics - Variables, Data types, Operators, Control Statements,Strings, Arrays and Functions.

2. Object Oriented Concepts - Classes, Objects, Constructors, Inheritance, Abstraction , 
Abstract classes, Interfaces, Polymorphism, Function overloading, Function overriding.

3. Java Strings - Java String class, different string methods present and interfaces 
implemented in this class.

3. Java collections - Collections, Threads, queue, sets, XML file operations, .

You can go check out the entire Java blog Series here. I hope you will find these 
pretty interesting and informative.

Also, there is a lot of free content available on YouTube which you can browse around to 
learn Java. You can go through this tutorial video on Java which will help you get started on the same.
